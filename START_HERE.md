# 🚀 Getting Started - Secure Environment Variables Version

Welcome! This is the **secure version** of the TripIt emoji calendar worker. It uses Cloudflare environment variables to keep your private TripIt URL separate from your code.

✅ **Safe for public GitHub** - Your TripIt URL never goes in the code
✅ **Encrypted** - Cloudflare stores it securely  
✅ **Professional** - Industry best practice
✅ **Easy to update** - Change URL without touching code
✅ **Share freely** - Safe to open source your repo

## 🎯 Quick Start (Choose Your Path)

### Option A: Deploy via Dashboard (Easiest) ⭐

1. **Go to Cloudflare**
   - Visit https://dash.cloudflare.com
   - Sign up or log in (free tier is perfect)

2. **Create Worker**
   - Workers & Pages → Create Application → Create Worker
   - Name it `tripit-emoji`
   - Click Deploy

3. **Add Code**
   - Click "Edit Code"
   - Delete default code
   - Copy ALL code from `tripit-emoji-worker.js`
   - Paste and click "Save and Deploy"

4. **Add Your TripIt URL (THE SECURE PART!)**
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Click "Variables and Secrets"
   - Click "Add variable"
   - Name: `TRIPIT_FEED_URL`
   - Value: Your TripIt URL (get from TripIt.com → Account Settings → Calendar Feeds)
   - Check "Encrypt" (recommended)
   - Click "Deploy"

5. **Test It**
   - Visit your worker URL in a browser
   - Should see ICS calendar data
   - Check for emojis in SUMMARY lines

6. **Use in Calendar**
   - Add your worker URL to your calendar app
   - Format: `https://tripit-emoji.YOUR-NAME.workers.dev`

### Option B: Deploy via Wrangler CLI (More Control)

1. **Install Wrangler**
   ```bash
   npm install -g wrangler
   ```

2. **Login**
   ```bash
   wrangler login
   ```

3. **Set Your Secret**
   ```bash
   cd tripit-emoji-worker
   wrangler secret put TRIPIT_FEED_URL
   ```
   When prompted, paste your TripIt URL

4. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   wrangler deploy
   ```

5. **Use the URL**
   - Wrangler shows your worker URL
   - Add to your calendar app

## 🧪 Local Testing (Optional)

Want to test locally first?

1. **Create .dev.vars**
   ```bash
   cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
   ```

2. **Edit .dev.vars**
   - Add your actual TripIt URL
   - This file is gitignored (safe!)

3. **Run locally**
   ```bash
   wrangler dev
   ```

4. **Test**
   - Visit `http://localhost:8787`
   - Should show your calendar with emojis

⚠️ **Never commit .dev.vars to Git!** (It's in .gitignore for your safety)

## 🔐 Security Overview

**How it works:**
1. Your TripIt URL is stored as a Cloudflare environment variable
2. The worker code reads from `env.TRIPIT_FEED_URL`
3. Your URL is NEVER in your code or Git history
4. Safe to share your code publicly

**Where your URL lives:**
- ✅ Cloudflare dashboard (encrypted)
- ✅ Wrangler secrets (encrypted)
- ✅ .dev.vars (local only, gitignored)
- ❌ NOT in tripit-emoji-worker.js
- ❌ NOT in Git repository
- ❌ NOT in GitHub

## ✨ What You'll Get

Once deployed, calendar events will have emojis:

- ✈️ **Flights:** "DL738 JFK to LAX"
- 🛎️ **Hotels:** "Check-in: Burton House"
- 🚘 **Car Rentals:** "Pick Up Rental Car: National"
- 🚙 **Parking:** "Drop Off Parking: JFK Airport"

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"TRIPIT_FEED_URL environment variable not set" error:**
- You forgot to add the environment variable
- Go to Settings → Variables and Secrets
- Add `TRIPIT_FEED_URL` with your TripIt URL
- Click "Deploy"

**Can't find Settings tab:**
- Make sure you're viewing your deployed worker
- Should see tabs: Quick Edit, Logs, Settings, Triggers, etc.

**Variable not working:**
- After adding variable, you MUST click "Deploy"
- Wait 30 seconds for deployment
- Try accessing your worker URL again

**Local testing not working:**
- Make sure you created `.dev.vars` (copy from `.dev.vars.example`)
- Make sure your TripIt URL is correct in `.dev.vars`
- Run `wrangler dev` from the project directory

## 🎉 You're Almost There!

1. Choose Option A (Dashboard) or Option B (Wrangler)
2. Follow the steps above
3. Test in your browser
